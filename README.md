AI assistant for human memory

Every second of our life, we see, we hear, we learn and we try to understand our world. Thanks to the autonomous subconsious mind, our experiences are automatically stored in our memory  But human memory is biological and bound to decay.
1) Many a times, we ask ourselves "where was the last time i saw my keys?", "who took my pen drive?", "I don't remember his name?", "What was taught in the last class?".
2) Often we ask others "please remind me to do this before evening" and then both of you forget and the work is left undone. We are too lazy to create reminders for everything :-) 
3) What about the embarrassment you suffer because you forget to switch off your mobile phone in an important meeting.  Infact according to some psychological research, more than 50% of our problems are because we didn't focus our attention on the right thing at the right time.  Human memory needs an assistant. This is where we comes in....  Our aim to is build an strong AI which can assist human brains! It will see the world and hear voices, just as humans do.

It will try to understand what's happening (or atleast mimic "understanding") and store its experiences in a memory chip. and IT NEVER FORGETS!
1) You can ask questions regarding past events 
2) It can automatically remind you at the right time 
3) It can learn to control the behaviour of your IoT devices  Now everyone will have photographic memory! you can explicitly ask it to remember events  It will be very helpful for people suffering from amnesia  Memento. Never forget a thing!
